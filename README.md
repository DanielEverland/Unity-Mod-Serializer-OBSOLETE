# Unity-Mod-Serializer
Serializer for easily creating mods in Unity games

The serializer allows you to export entire Unity projects in human-readable format. Necessary binary files like assemblies are kept in a separate lookup, while individual prefabs are serialized in JSON. This makes them incredibly easy to edit post-build, while still allowing you to use the entire fleet of features in the Unity editor.
